					<h1>About me</h1>
					<p>In high school, I started working in customer service and was in that business for about ten years. I was able to work my way from a server to an Assistant General Manager and General Manager position. While working in the restaurant business, I built a cryptocurrency mining rig in 2017, and I have since been pursuing a job that involves working with technology and computers. Last year, I made the jump from the restaurant business and enrolled myself in Cybersecurity and Computer Networking at Bismarck State College. I have been a full-time student since last August, I have been maintaining a 4.0GPA, and I was selected for President's Honor Roll. I have enjoyed my studies, and I have accepted a position as the Vice President of BSC's Cyber Club. I enjoy mentoring fellow students and helping them succeed in their classes. I look forward to the opportunities I will receive pursuing in this field.</p>
